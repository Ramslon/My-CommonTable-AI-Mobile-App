# AI Bias & Fairness at CommonTable AI

We want every student and community member to feel represented, respected, and supported. This page explains how we approach fairness, inclusivity, and culturally diverse nutrition guidance.

---

## Our fairness goals

- Provide inclusive, culturally-aware suggestions for meals and nutrition.
- Reduce harmful or exclusionary outputs (e.g., stereotyping, insensitive language).
- Support a range of dietary patterns (omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, low-carb, high-protein) and local staples.
- Offer budget-friendly and accessibility-aware recommendations where possible.

## Data and model sources

- We use a combination of:
  - Public nutrition references and guidelines (e.g., macro ranges, balanced plate visuals).
  - Culturally diverse food examples (e.g., rice/beans, plantains, lentils, oats, yogurt/fermented foods).
  - Optional third-party AI providers (Gemini, Hugging Face) when enabled.
- When "Offline Mode" is ON, the app uses a local, simplified knowledge base and simulated suggestions to avoid network calls.

## Bias risks we monitor

Even with guardrails, AI systems can reflect and amplify bias. Key risks include:

- Over-representing Western-centric foods or patterns.
- Ignoring budget constraints or local availability.
- Recommending foods that clash with cultural, religious, or personal preferences.
- Using language that feels judgmental or prescriptive.

## Mitigation strategies

- Prompting for cultural and budget context (e.g., “use local staples,” “vegetarian-only”).
- Including diverse staples in suggestions (beans, lentils, rice, plantain, leafy greens, fermented dairy/foods, etc.).
- Short, actionable guidance focused on options—not mandates.
- Explicitly avoiding medical claims; we encourage consulting a registered professional for medical conditions.
- When online AI is used, we instruct models to avoid stereotypes and to provide neutral, supportive tone.

## Evaluation and review

- We review representative prompts across different regions, diets, and budgets.
- We track issues reported by users and make prompt/data updates.
- We inspect outputs for:
  - Representativeness (multiple cuisines/staples)
  - Sensitivity (non-judgmental language)
  - Practicality (budget-friendly, simple foods)

## Your controls

- AI Provider: choose Simulated (offline), Gemini, or Hugging Face in Settings → App Preferences.

## How to help us improve
